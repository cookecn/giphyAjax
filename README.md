# About
* giphyAjax is my sixth homework assignment for the Vanderbilt University Coding Bootcamp. This assignment has us utilizing an api request using the Ajax syntax. We are collecting the response data from the Giphy API, and appending our html page with that information. For this assignemnt we need to show 10 gifs on the page after a button is selected. The user can create new buttons using the input form. The 10 images that appear should be still, and once clicked, should then animate. If clicked again, the images should return to the data-still position. 

# Contributions
